// Cloudflare Email Service, not a third-party sender. Same vendor as the Worker
// and the database, one dashboard, and the sender domain is verified in the
// account that already runs mgcrea.io's DNS — so there are no records to copy
// between two providers and get subtly wrong. It sends to arbitrary recipients,
// which the older Email Routing binding could not: that one could only reach
// addresses already verified as forwarding destinations, which is useless for
// reaching a customer.
//
// The page and the mail are both shipped, and they are not redundant. /thanks
// covers mail being slow or filtered; the mail covers the far more common case
// of closing the tab. A licence the buyer cannot find is indistinguishable from
// one they never received — and that is the case that becomes a chargeback,
// which costs about twice the sale price.
//
// The key goes in the body AND as an attachment. The body is what someone reads
// on a phone; the attachment is what they drop on the Licence pane without
// selecting 240 characters of base64 by hand.
//
// No refund promise in this copy, deliberately. Cupertino's says thirty days
// because cupertino has that policy; Bastion has no published terms at all yet,
// and a sentence here would be the first place one was invented.
