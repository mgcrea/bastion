// signatures, and each is HMAC-SHA256 over `<timestamp>.<raw body>` keyed by the
// endpoint secret, verbatim including its `whsec_` prefix.
//
// Two things here are not optional. The body must be the RAW text, because
// re-serialising the JSON changes bytes Stripe signed. And the timestamp must be
// checked, because a signature with no freshness bound is a replay waiting to
// happen — a captured `checkout.session.completed` could otherwise be posted
// back forever.
