/// `scripts/lib/license.test.mjs` is JavaScript checking JavaScript: it proves
/// the issuer is self-consistent and proves nothing about the program that has
/// to accept its output. The disagreement that would actually cost money lives
/// between the two languages — base64url padding, or a signature taken over the
/// parsed claims on one side and the encoded payload on the other — and it is
/// invisible until a paying customer pastes a key that Node called valid.
///
/// So this compiles `License.swift` itself, unmodified, and feeds it cases from
/// `scripts/license-check.mjs` on stdin. A standalone `swiftc` binary rather
/// than an XCTest bundle for the same reason as `wiring-check.swift`: the Xcode
/// project has no test target, and adding one means hand-editing project.pbxproj.
///
/// Run with `make license-check`.
/// Stands in for AppInfo.swift, which `License.swift` reaches only through the
/// `major:` default — and which would drag `AppSupport` and the real bundle in
/// behind it. Every case below passes its major explicitly, so this is never the
/// value under test. `Revocations.swift` is compiled for real instead of stubbed:
/// it is four lines and no dependencies, so there is nothing to gain by faking it.
